Hi there 👋 I'm Thanasis
I'm a Lead Web Developer based in the UK.

Over the past few years, I’ve gone from Web Developer to Lead, working on front-end development, performance optimisation, and mentoring developers. I enjoy turning designs into accessible, responsive, and scalable components.

These days, I’m leading web projects at the University of Hertfordshire, focusing on HTML5, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, and Squiz DXP.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- Building reusable components with JSON & vanilla JS
- Improving accessibility & performance across large-scale sites
- Exploring React/Next.js to grow my modern front-end skills

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a big fan of co-op games like Helldivers 2 and Monster Hunter: World 🎮
